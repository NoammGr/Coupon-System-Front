# Coupon-System-Front

Welcome to my coupon-system frontend project, in this project I'm making the ui for the clients to use,
In this project I'm using React with TS, the components returning TSX and CSS for styles.

## Project structure

- React framework
- TypeScript

## React

### Libraries

I work with these libraries in order to make the project more functional.

- Axios: with this library I made all the requests (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE...) to server , Also I use async functions and
  await for the response.
- React-hook-form: with this library I manage all the forms in the project, for example, if I want to allow
  a client to add coupon, or to allow the admin to add a company, I use the form to send the data properly.
- Notyf: I use this library to display messages to clients, for example, success massages will be displayed when
  the operation is completed successfully, in case of error, an error message will be displayed.
- JWT-decode: helps me to decode tokens and to pass it to the server side the right way.
- React-router-dom: with this library I can redirect users to a new path/page without reloading.
  this is making the principle of SPA.
